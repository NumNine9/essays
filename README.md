To find the probability that the number of unauthorized access attempts is no greater than \( k = 35 \) using a geometric distribution, we first need to understand the parameters of the distribution.

In a geometric distribution, the probability of success on any single trial is denoted by \( p \), which in this case is the probability of successfully preventing each unauthorized access attempt, given as \( p = 0.97 \).

The probability mass function (PMF) of a geometric distribution is given by:
\[ P(X=k) = (1-p)^{k-1} \cdot p \]

Where:
- \( P(X=k) \) is the probability that the first success occurs on the \( k \)-th trial.
- \( p \) is the probability of success on each trial.

To find the probability that the number of unauthorized access attempts is no greater than \( k = 35 \), we sum the probabilities for \( k = 1, 2, 3, \ldots, 35 \).

\[ P(X \leq 35) = P(X = 1) + P(X = 2) + \ldots + P(X = 35) \]

Substituting the values into the PMF formula:
\[ P(X \leq 35) = (1 - 0.97)^{1-1} \cdot 0.97 + (1 - 0.97)^{2-1} \cdot 0.97 + \ldots + (1 - 0.97)^{35-1} \cdot 0.97 \]

\[ P(X \leq 35) = (0.03)^0 \cdot 0.97 + (0.03)^1 \cdot 0.97 + \ldots + (0.03)^{34} \cdot 0.97 \]

Since \( (0.03)^0 = 1 \) and \( (0.03)^1 = 0.03 \), the calculation becomes:
\[ P(X \leq 35) = 0.97 + (0.03) \cdot 0.97 + \ldots + (0.03)^{34} \cdot 0.97 \]

This sum can be computed using appropriate software or by utilizing geometric series summation formulas.
